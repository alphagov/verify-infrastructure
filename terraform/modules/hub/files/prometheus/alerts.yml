        This is an alert meant to ensure that the entire alerting pipeline is functional.
        This alert is always firing, therefore it should always be firing in Alertmanager
        and always fire against a receiver.  We use cronitor to alert us if this ever
        *doesn't* fire, because this indicates a problem with our alerting pipeline
